# A browser. Why not?

I built an app that had a bunch of webViews back when I was first learning Obj-C and I have wanted to make amends for that... I have wanted to make a 'proper' browser for a while now but never actually focused on it...

- [x] search
- [ ] bookmark, this will need time.
- [x] forward and back
- [x] http sites - attempted. Succeeded but don't want for now.
- [ ] user profile
- [ ] search history
- [ ] private browsing
- [ ] tabs
- [ ] I'm sure there will be other stuff.
